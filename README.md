This tool is inspired by the paper
*Exploring Breaks in the Distribution of Stock Returns: Empirical Evidence from Apple Inc.*

Full credit goes to the original authors of the paper
for the ideas herein.
I owe a tremendous debt to these authors.

## ðŸ“Š Changepoints

The paper above defines a changepoint as follows.

The **changepoints** of a time series $\{Y_t\}_{1:T}$
form a partition $\rho_{1:T}$ of the set $\{1, \dots, T\}$
such that certain statistical properties are the same
within a sub-sequence and different between sub-sequences.

> This tool focuses on mean and variance of log returns,
> but any statistic can be examined.

The problem is essentially an $O(2^{T-1})$ search problem
in partition space.

## ðŸ“„ Overview of methods

### Evaluation criteria

The paper penalizes the training and evaluates performance
across model classes with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
Hannanâ€“Quinn Information Criterion (HQIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
For now, this tool uses only BIC to compare results across models.

### Detection methods

#### Hidden Markov Models

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is implemented using `hmmlearn`.
Like in the paper, $N = 1, \dots, 8$ hidden states are considered.

#### Likelihood ratio

This tools makes use of the package `ruptures`,
based on [1]

#### Changepoint detection methods

TODO

#### Bayesian methods

## ðŸ“„ How to use

This tool can be used as a library to use methods individually,
or it can be used as a CLI to get a summary of each method.

```bash
changepoint-detector -f data/aapl.csv
```

The input data must be a csv of daily price data
in the following format:
```csv
Date,AAPL
1980-12-12,0.09905774146318436
1980-12-15,0.09388983249664307
```

This is the default format when exporting price data from `yfinance`.
```python
yf.download("SPY")["Adj Close"].to_csv("./spy_daily.csv")
```
Only a single security is supported at this time.

## ðŸ“„ Devlog

- 3 statistics: mean, var, and mean + var
- for some reason, `numpy==1.26.1` is required for `hmmlearn` to behave nicely and converge
- `python3.11` is a no-go; `pychangepoint` can't install for some reason.

## ðŸ“„ TODO

- usic BIC to find optimal penalty hyperparam for LRM
- usic BIC to score all results of final changepoints
- GLR test for CM
- convert HMM back to individual instances
- "tool is indeded to benchmark methods"
- find a solution for segments of length 1
